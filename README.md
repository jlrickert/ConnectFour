# 1. PREREQUISITES

This project requires:
  - Cross-platform Make (CMake) v3.1.1+
  - GNU Make or equivalent.
  - GCC or an alternative, reasonably conformant C compiler.

# 2. BUILDING

This project uses the Cross-platform Make (CMake) build system. However, we
have conveniently provided a wrapper configure script and Makefile so that
the typical build invocation of "./configure" followed by "make" will work.
For a list of all possible build targets, use the command "make help".

NOTE: Users of CMake may believe that the top-level Makefile has been
generated by CMake; it hasn't, so please do not delete that file.

# 3. INSTALLING

Once the project has been built (see "INSTALL"), execute "sudo make install".

NOTE: Installing is optional and not needed to run the application.

# 4. CONTRIBUTING

TODO: Enhance section.
